# Studio-Project-Code

## 2/2/25
I was thinking that I could recycle my old work from creating buttons and mesh that with some of the writing interaction code I have to make some sort of text response code, a la Fallout 1. I do think that might be too hard so I might try use buttons instead to create a pick your own adventure type of work, I don't know what the theme of this story would be, it needs to be something interesting and relevant to me.
